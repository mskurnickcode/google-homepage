At the moment this I'm currently working through both the Oding Project (starting with basics and then working through the javascript secontion) and CS50 Web.  Both of them require a creating a Google Homepage as the initial part of the project so I've created this replica of Regular Google, Google Image, and Part of the Advanced Search options.

I used HTML and CSS for this project.
